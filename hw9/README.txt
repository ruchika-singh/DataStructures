HASH FUNCTION DESCRIPTION
My hash function is the same one that we did in lab for the ds_hashset. 
I chose to use this function because it works well with strings and all my 
keys were the strings of the movie inputs put together so it worked out fairly well.
I inputed those strings as keys and the function returned the hash value that I 
used to get my index.

HASH TABLE IMPLEMENTATION
My hash table is based of the ds_hashset that we had used in class and lab.
The table is a vector of lists and the keys are each hashstring that is 
a movie's information put into a string and then the hash funciton. I had to alter
the insert to work with my keys and linear probing, also the find and resize I changed.
In the main creating the table I had to add the occupancy as a variable as well.
